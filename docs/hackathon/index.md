# **Build Your Legacy: Contribute to Rust Open-Source!** 🌟

---

## **Why Open-Source? Your Career Rocket Fuel** 🚀

Open-source is where **code meets community**. By contributing to Rust projects, you:

- 🛠️ **Gain real-world experience** with industry-standard tools
- 📈 **Showcase skills to employers** (GitHub = your living resume)
- 🤝 **Collaborate with global developers**
- 💡 **Learn faster** through code reviews and mentorship

**The stats don’t lie:**

- 84% of hiring managers value open-source contributions _(2023 Open Source Jobs Report)_

## Chose a Project to Contribute

We’ve compiled an extensive list of open-source Rust projects, ranging from CLI applications and operating systems to games and servers.

**Projects List:** **[Visit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17BxGBBtn4a0G2yWU_ngfr20-PePO-kfmuUku4ADwE7E/edit?usp=sharing)**

### Step 1: Choose a Project

Select a project that interests you and look for issues labeled with `good first issue`, `easy`, or any other label that indicates it’s beginner-friendly.

### Step 2: Review CONTRIBUTE.md

Read the `CONTRIBUTE.md` file carefully. This document outlines the guidelines you need to follow to ensure your contributions are eligible for integration.

### Step 3: Claim Your Issue

To avoid multiple hackathon participants working on the same issue, add a link to the issue you are working on in front of your name in the below document. This helps maintain clarity and coordination.

## **Your First Pull Request: A 5-Step Blueprint** 🔧

### **Step 1: Fork & Clone**

```bash
# Clone YOUR fork (replace with your fork URL)
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/PROJECT-NAME.git
cd PROJECT-NAME
```

### **Step 2: Create a Dedicated Branch**

Chose a descriptive name for your branch, check CONTRIBUTE.md if there are a special formating for branch names.

```bash
git checkout -b <YOUR-BRANCH-NAME> # Branch names like "fix-readme-typo" work too!
```

### **Step 3: Make Meaningful Changes**

**Examples for Rust projects:**

- Fix docs in `src/lib.rs`
- Add tests in `tests/module.rs`
- Improve error messages in `src/error.rs`

### **Step 4: Commit Like a Pro**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "docs: Improve API documentation clarity"
# Use conventional prefixes: feat, fix, docs, test, chore
```

`feat` => for adding a new functionality.

- e.g: adding a new component, endpoint or user interaction.

`fix` => for fixing an error or bug.

- e.g: resolving crashes, incorrect behavior, or edge cases.

`docs` => for updates on documentation.

- e.g: writing or editing README.md.

`test` => for implementing tests.

- e.g: writing new test cases.

`chore` => routine tasks that don't affect functionality.

- e.g: update dependecies

### **Step 5: Push & Create PR**

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin <YOUR-BRANCH-NAME>
```

**Then:**

1. Go to your fork on GitHub
2. Click **“Compare & Pull Request”**
3. Write a clear description:

```markdown
## What changed?

- Added examples to `serde` parsing docs
- Fixed broken link in contribution guide

## Why?

Makes it easier for new users to understand error handling.
```

## **You’re Never Alone!** 🙌

**Volunteers are here for:**

- 🚨 **"Help, my Rust won’t compile!"** – We’ll debug trait errors
- 🔄 **Git nightmares** – Resolve conflicts, rebase disasters
- 📜 **Project navigation** – Where to add tests/docs

---

## **Closing Note: You’re Making History**

Thank you for joining the Rust revolution! Every line you write:

- 🛠️ Strengthens critical infrastructure (yes, Rust runs satellites!)
- 🌱 Inspires future developers
- 🔥 Proves open-source thrives on **collaboration over competition**

**“The Rust community grows one contribution at a time – and today, that’s YOU.”**
