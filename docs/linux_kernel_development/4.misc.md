# Misc Driver

We want to control the power off driver from user space.

## Exercises

1. Implement an IOCTL Read command that sends a number to the driver and the driver prints it to the console.
2. Implement and IOCTL command that starts a task to power off QEMU. The time in seconds is supplied by the userspace.
3. Implement an IOCTL to stop the power off.

## Bonus

Implement an IOCTL command that return to userspace the amount of time remained until power off.
