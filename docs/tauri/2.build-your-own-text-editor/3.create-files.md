# **Task 3: Add "Create File" Functionality**

**Extend your editor with file creation capabilities**

---

### **Core Implementation Roadmap**

1. **Backend Command**

   - Add a Rust function `create_file(path: String)` using `std::fs::File::create`
   - Expose via Tauri command

2. **Frontend UI**

   - Add a "📄 New File" button to the toolbar
   - Link it to Tauri’s `save()` dialog for path selection

3. **File Explorer Sync**

   - After creation, refresh the parent directory in the sidebar
   - Reuse `get_child_paths` from Task 2

4. **Security, if needed**
   - Allow file creation in permitted directories via `tauri.conf.json`

### **Final Conclusion**

You’ve achieved to create a text editor with foundational file management capabilities!  
**"To create is to breathe life into the inert. Now your editor pulses with possibility."**
