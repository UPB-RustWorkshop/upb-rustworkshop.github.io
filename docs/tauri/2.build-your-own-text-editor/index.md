# Build Your Own Text Editor

_"Are you excited?ðŸ˜„"_

**"Rust is the bridge between fearless system control and modern application development."**

This project isnâ€™t just about building a text editorâ€”itâ€™s a **deep dive into full-stack systems programming**. Youâ€™ll stitch together:

### **Core Concepts Unlocked**

- **Rustâ€™s Memory Safety**: Direct file I/O with `std::fs` (no segfaults, no leaks)
- **Cross-Language Pipelines**: TypeScript â†” Rust communication via Tauriâ€™s IPC
- **System-Level APIs**: Native file dialogs, directory traversal, OS permissions
- **State Management**: Sync UI with filesystem changes in real time

### **Why Rust?**

- **Concurrency Ready**: Future-proof foundation for async file watching
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Raw performance for file operations
- **Portability**: Compile to Windows/macOS/Linux with one codebase

### **Skill Progression**

1. **Task 1**: Rust as backend engine (file I/O)
2. **Task 2**: Rust as system navigator (directory structures)
3. **Task 3**: Rust as creator (file lifecycle management)

**"Youâ€™re not just coding an editorâ€”youâ€™re architecting a symphony of system resources."**
