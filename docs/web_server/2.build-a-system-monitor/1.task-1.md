# Task 1: Organize the project structure and set up the `/healthcheck` endpoint

Before diving in, first we'll setup some conventions for organizing the code, which will help us maintain a clean and scalable project structure, benefits of the Rust module system.

The router will live inside the `src/routes` module, and each endpoint will have its own module. This way, we can keep the codebase organized and easy to navigate.

To do so, we'll update the directory structure as such:

```bash
upb-rust-workshop/
├─ src/
│  ├─ routes/
│  │  └─ mod.rs
│  └─ main.rs      # Entry point
├─ target/         # Build artifacts
├─ .gitignore      # Git ignore file
├─ Cargo.lock      # Dependency lock file
└─ Cargo.toml      # Project manifest
```

Within `src/routes/mod.rs`, we'll move the router initialization from `main.rs` as follows:

```rust title="src/routes/mod.rs"
use axum::Router;

pub fn app() -> Router {
    Router::new().route("/", get(async || "Hello, World!"))
}
```

After that, the `main.rs` will become:

```rust title="src/main.rs"
pub mod routes;

use axum;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:8080").await.unwrap();
    println!(
        "Server running on http://{}",
        listener.local_addr().unwrap()
    );
    axum::serve(listener, routes::app()).await.unwrap();
}
```

If you run the server now, you should see the message `Server running on http://0.0.0.0:8080`, and the `/` endpoint should return `Hello, World!`.

Now, let's add a `/healthcheck` endpoint to our server. This endpoint will be used to check if the server is running and healthy.

To do so, create a new module `src/routes/healthcheck.rs` and add the following code:

```rust title="src/routes/healthcheck.rs"
use axum::{Router, http::StatusCode, response::IntoResponse, routing::get};

pub fn register() -> Router {
    Router::new().route("/", get(health_check))
}

async fn health_check() -> impl IntoResponse {
    todo!("Implement the health check endpoint")
}
```

Next, update `src/routes/mod.rs` to include the new module:

```rust title="src/routes/mod.rs"
use axum::Router;

mod healthcheck;

pub fn app() -> Router {
    Router::new().nest("/healthcheck", healthcheck::register())
}
```

Why we did that? By nesting the `/healthcheck` route inside the main router, we can easily add more routes in the future without cluttering the main router.

## Your Task

As task, implement the `health_check` function to return a `200 OK` status code with the message `Server is running`.

## Conclusion

In this task, we've organized the project structure and added a `/healthcheck` endpoint to our server. This will help us maintain a clean and scalable codebase as we add more features to our web server.
