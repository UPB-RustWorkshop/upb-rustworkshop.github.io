# Introduction to Axum: Building Web Servers in Rust

Welcome to the workshop on building web servers with **Axum**! In this session, we'll explore why Rust and Axum are a powerful combination for modern web development. Letâ€™s dive in!

---

## What is Axum?

**Axum** is a fast, ergonomic, and type-safe web framework for Rust, built on top of the [`tokio`](https://tokio.rs/) async runtime and [`hyper`](https://hyper.rs/) HTTP library. Developed by the Tokio team, Axum leverages Rustâ€™s strengths to provide a robust foundation for building scalable and reliable web services.

## Key Features and benefits

1. **Declarative routing**:

- define routes and handlers using a clean, intuitive API
- Supports RESTful patterns, path parameters, and query extraction

2. **Middleware and composability**:

- Integrates seamlessly with `tower` middleware (e.g., logging, CORS, rate limiting, observability).
- Middleware can be applied globally, per route, or per scope.

3. **Async-first**:

- Built on top of `tokio`, Axum is designed for high-performance, non-blocking I/O.
- Write handlers using `async/await` for efficient request processing.

4. **JSON and Form handling**:

- Effortless serialization/deserialization using `serde`.
- Extract and validate data with types like `Json<T>` or `Form<T>`.

## Why Rust for Web servers?

### ðŸš€ Performance

- Rust compiles to native code, offering C-level speed with no garbage collector overhead.
- Ideal for high-throughput, low-latency applications.
- No runtime overhead thanks to Rustâ€™s zero-cost abstractions.

### ðŸ¦º Safety

- Rustâ€™s type system ensures correctness at compile time (e.g., path parameters, request bodies).
- Rustâ€™s ownership model eliminates entire classes of bugs (e.g., null pointers, data races).
- Critical for security in networked services.

### âš¡ Concurrency Without Fear

- Async/await syntax simplifies writing safe, concurrent code.
- Avoid callback hell or runtime magic seen in other languages.

### ðŸŒ± Growing Ecosystem

- A vibrant community with libraries for HTTP, databases, auth, and more.
- Tools like `cargo` make dependency management painless.

### ðŸ“¦ Cross-Platform Support

- Compile to Linux, Windows, macOS, or even embedded systems.

## Why Axum over other frameworks?

1. **Batteries-included, but unopinionated**:
   Axum provides essential tools without forcing a specific project structure.

2. **Production ready**: Backed by `tokio` and `hyper`, it powers high-traffic services in production.

3. **Future-proof**: Rustâ€™s stability guarantees ensure long-term maintainability.

4. **Learning Curve Pays Off**: While Rust has a steeper initial learning curve, the long-term benefits in reliability and performance are unmatched.

## Use cases

- Building microservices or REST/GraphQL APIs.
- High-performance proxies or gateways.
- Applications where safety and correctness are critical (e.g., fintech, healthcare).
